<DIV class="concept-description">
<P>        HTML stands for <EM>Hypertext Markup Language.</EM> Its a language 
with syntax and rules.  HTML documents form the majority of the content on the 
web.        HTML documents contain <EM>text content</EM> which describes        
"what you see" and <EM>markup</EM> which describes "how it        looks". <A

<DIV>
<P><B>Tags and Elements</B>       </P>
<P>        HTML documents are made of HTML <B>elements</B>. When        writing 
HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element        by using HTML 
<B>tags</B>.         <BR><IMG alt="Element Example" src="index_files/html-layout-xhtml-content.gif"> 
      </P></DIV>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>DOM</B>     </DIV>
<DIV>            The DOM stands for Document Object Model.  The Document Object 
Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and 
scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of 
documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that 
processing can be incorporated back into the presented page.         <BR>        
To render a document such as an HTML page, most web browsers use an internal 
model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree 
structure, called the DOM tree, with topmost node named "Document object". When 
an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local 
memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.

<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Inline vs Block Elements</B>    </DIV>
<DIV>          HTML elements are either <B>inline</B> or <B>block</B>.        
Block elements form an "invisible box" around the        content inside of them. 
 All elements are rectangular.     </DIV>

        HTML elements are either <B>inline</B> or <B>block</B>.        Block

<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Search and Replace</B>     </DIV>
<P>          You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you 
identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find (or match, in CSS 
terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to 
replace with different one       </P>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Order Matters</B>     </DIV>        It also 
matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles 
can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with 
definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:             
<UL>
  <LI>the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different 
  styles)</LI>
  <LI>stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)</LI>
  <LI>stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not 
  ideal)</LI>
  <LI>inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be 
  avoided)</LI></UL>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Specifics Matter</B>     </DIV>
<P>        "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements 
they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, 
if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more 
specific rule takes effect.       </P>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Repetition</B>     </DIV>
<P>         One of the principles of programming is "Don't Repeat Yourself" 
(DRY).  Repetition only clutters your code and makes it difficult for the next 
programmer to debug it.         Selectors are what allows you to target specifc 
HTML elements and apply style to them.  By doing this, you can condense your CSS 
to avoid unnecessary repetition, which waste time, and time is precious.

<H2>Intro to Serious Programming</H2></DIV>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>What is Programming</B>     </DIV>
<P>        Computers are machines that must be told what to do.  As a programmer 
your job will be to write programs to tell the computer what to do.         <BR> 
       Programming is the core of computer science.  A program describes the 
sequence of steps to complete an action.            <BR>        A programming 
language is a rule based set of instructions.  The computer uses a compiler to 
interpret this and execute it.  Examples of programming languages are Python, 
C++, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.         <BR>        Python will be taught in 
this class.  Once the code is written, it must run through a Python Interpreter 
to covert it into computer instructions.         <BR>        If programming 
grammar is not followed, the interpreter will return a syntax error; this means 
the structure of the code is inconsistent with the rules of the programming 
language. Backus-Naur Form is used to describe a programming language in a 
simple and concise manner.         <BR>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Expressions</B>      </DIV>

<H1>STAGE 3: PROGRAM WITH OBJECTS</H1></DIV>
<DIV class="concept-description"></DIV>
<DIV class="session">
<H2>OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING</H2></DIV> 
OOP is a fancy name for programming languages that use objects.  It's a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. The course so far has taught us programming is a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.
<p>
OOP will help us concentrate on the things we want to program (hence objects) and not just how to write the logic.
<p>
Previously we concentrated on Functions.  <em><b>def</b></em> was used to define functions because we were concerned with the definiton of things.
Now we want to logically group data and functions by using <em><b>class</b></em> to define a class.
<p>
Examples of objects range from tax forms (described by SS#, Adjusted Gross Income, Taxable Income) to humans marked by name, address and phone numbers. <br>
The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, an exercise often known as data modeling. 
Once an object has been identified,  it is generalized as a class of objects (an example is a blueprint which is the design for all buildings).  This class defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it (room size, floors and stairs). <br>
The class Turtle contains info like move forward, back, etc.  We used that class to create instances named Brad and Angie.<br>
Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages. 
<p>
It turns out Object-oriented programming can make my future career easier as a programmer.  So now I can produce more work by reusing code that fits related projects.<br>
Here's how:<br>
The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Called inheritance, this property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time, and ensures more accurate coding. <br>
Since a class defines only the data it needs to be concerned with, when an instance of that class (an object) is run, the code will not be able to accidentally access other program data. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater system security and avoids unintended data corruption. <br>
The definition of a class is reuseable not only by the program for which it is initially created but also by other object-oriented programs (and, for this reason, can be more easily distributed for use in networks). The concept of data classes allows a programmer to create any new data type that is not already defined in the language itself.
<p>
So we built the class Movie to contain basic metadata that applies to all movies.  I can reuse my class over and over with the init to intialize the object and self to create the instance to apply my movie intstructions on.<br>
Just as style properties cascade in CSS, class methods and properties 'cascade' down to derived classes.  OOP is the sliced bread of programming!!!
<DIV class="session">
<H2>OOP AND SCALABILITY</H2></DIV> 
Object-oriented programming has demonstrated its superiority over procedural programming as an architecture choice in several programming languages. It encourages cleaner interfaces between sections of the code, it is easier to debug, and it scales better for large programming teams.  It's a very valuable tool for large programming projects.<P>
Object-oriented programming is claimed to promote greater flexibility and maintainability in programming, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Furthermore, proponents of OOP claim that OOP is easier to learn for those new to computer programming than previous approaches, and that the OOP approach is often simpler to develop and to maintain, lending itself to more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than other programming methods.

<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2></DIV>
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>What is Abstraction</B>     </DIV>
<P>        The hiding of detail behind documentation.  Programmers write code in 
the Python language which calls complex levels of functionality behind the 
scenes.       

<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Why use Functions</B>     </DIV>
Functions do 3 things:
<OL>
  <LI>They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.</LI>
  <LI>They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.</LI>
  <LI>Using 1 and 2 they let you make your own "mini-scripts" or "tiny commands."</LI></OL>
<P>        So far we've been writing a lot of functions. This is essentially 
writing code one at a time.       
<P>        some_module.py<SPAN class="tab4"><I>***We create an empty python 
file***</I></SPAN>         <BR><SPAN class="tab">def do.this<SPAN 
class="tab4"><I>***Then we add a function***</I></SPAN></SPAN><BR><SPAN class="tab">def 
do.that<SPAN class="tab4"><I>***Then we add another 
function***</I></SPAN></SPAN><BR>         return result  
<DIV class="concept-title"><B>Python Standard Library Functions</B>     </DIV>
<BR><IMG alt="Python Library" src="index_files/PythonStandardLibraryFunctions.gif">
<P><B>Webbrowser</B> - This module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying Web-based documents to users</P>
<P><B>Time</B> - This module provides various time-related functions</P>
<p>Project example: Take a Break
This code will use the Time and Webbrowser modules and uses the follwoing funtions:</p>
<UL>
  <LI>time.sleep - will suspend execution for a given number of seconds</LI>
  <LI>time.ctime - gives the current time of the computer</LI></UL>

<P><B>OS</B> - This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent funtionality</P>
<p>Project example: Secret Message
This code will get the file names and rename each one</p>
<UL>
  <LI>os.listdir - returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path.  The list is in arbitrary order.  It does not include the special entries '_' and "__" even if they are present in the directory.</LI>
  <LI>os.getcwd - returns a string representing the current working diretory</LI>
  <LI>os.rename - renames the file or directory</LI>
  <LI>os.chdir - this will change the current working directory to path</LI></UL>

<P><B>Turtle</B> - Inside of the file 'turtle' is a class called Turtle.
It's a neatly packaged box that puts things together very well.
<br>turtle.Turtle()
This the function <em><b>init</b></em> which stands for initialize.  It creates space in memory for a new instance or object of the class turtle.</P>
<BR><IMG alt="Python Library" src="index_files/turtle.gif">
<DIV class="session">
<H2>CLASSES</H2></DIV>    A Class is a template that can be reused.     
<P><B>What is the Python FROM?</B> - For importing a specific variable, class or a function from a module</P>
<P><B>What is a CLASS?</B> - A class is something that just contain the 
structure (how something should be loading out or structured)</P>
<P><B>What is an instance of a CLASS?</B> - Since the class doesn't fill in any 
content, instances contain the classes content</P>
<P><B>Analogy to explain Classes:</B> - Everybody has to fill out a tax form but 
the content they put in it differs from person to person. A class is like the 
form: it specifies what content should exist. Your copy of the form with your 
specific information if like an instance of the class: it specifies what the 
content actually is (hence your AGI and what you pay the government).</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Class is like a blueprint. A blueprint of a building contains info like 
  height and width of walls. We can use one blueprint to build several buildings 
  (instances or objects).</LI>
  <LI>The class Turtle contains info like move forward, back, etc.  We used that 
  class to create instances named Brad and Angie.</LI>
  <LI>The class Movie (used in following project) needs data (title, storyline, poster image, trailer 
  link).</LI>
  <LI>It is good practice to create class definition in one file and call/use it 
  from another file.</LI></UL>
<p>Project example: Make Classes Movie Website</p>
This project has a file called media. Inside this file is a defined a class called Movie. The code media.Movie(): calls the init function to construct space.
<UL>
  <LI>The code media.Movie(): calls the init function to construct space.</LI>
  <LI>The movies will be the Instance</LI>
  <LI>The init function will be constructed</LI>
  <LI>The self object being created is the movie</LI>
  <LI>Unique instant variables are represented for each class (ex. title, storyline, poster_image_url and trailer_youtube_url)</LI>
  <LI>Instant methods are defined for each class and associated to an instance</LI>
  <LI>We'll use webbrowser.open to play the YouTube trailers</LI></UL>

<DIV class="session">
<H2>OBJECT ORIENTED TERMINOLOGY</H2></DIV>
<P><B>Object</B> - Refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.</P>
<P><B>Class</B> -  A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </P>
<P><B>Instance</B> - An object of a class.  Class is to a recipe as instance is to the cake from that recipe.</P>
<P><B>Constructor</B> - Constructs the init functions</P>
<P><B>Self</B> - Is the object being created (the movie)</P>
<P><B>Method</B> - A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</P>
<P><B>Instant Method</B> - A function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an instance</P>
<P><B>Module</B> - The file containing Python definitions and statements.  The file name will have the suffic .py appended.</P>
<P><B>Library</B> - Bible to all things Python including modules such as webbrowser, time, os, turtle and many many more.</P>
<P><B>Class Variable</B> - A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are. </P>
<P><B>Instance Variable</B> - A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class. This makes it unique to each instance of class (movie project ex. title, storyline, poster_image_url and trailer_youtube_url)</P>
<P><B>Inheritance</B> - The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it. </P>
<P><B>Method Overriding</B> - ability of a class to change the implementation of a method provided by one of its ancestors. Overriding is a very important part of OOP since it is the feature that makes inheritance exploit its full power. Through method overriding a class may "copy" another class, avoiding duplicated code, and at the same time enhance or customize part of it. Method overriding is thus a strict part of the inheritance mechanism.</P></BODY></HTML>
